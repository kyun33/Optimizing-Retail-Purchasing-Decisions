# Optimizing-Retail-Purchasing-Decisions
Using given product and sales data of a retail company, I had to analyze product-level sales patterns, forecast demand for each product for the next 30 days, and recommend which products to reorder and the approximate quantities of each product. I analyzed and visualized the current data and used random forest modeling to make the prediction of the company's next month's sales. I used visualizations to communicate the findings more clearly. 

Skills used: scikit-learn, random forest, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, business analytics, data analysis, data visualization, predicitive business insights
